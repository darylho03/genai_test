Okay, so I need to summarize the plot of "Severance." Let me start by recalling what I remember about the show. I think it's a dark comedy that centers around a man named George who has a serious mental health issue with dissociative identity disorder (DID). The story involves him dealing with his past, which leads to some intense and emotional moments.

I remember George is introduced in a small town where everything seems normal at first. He gets into trouble because of his ID, so he goes through various stages of self-discovery. His life changes from being a successful, happy man with friends and a family to something more chaotic and isolating.

There's a twist when George starts experiencing strange hallucinations that look like something real is happening, not just his mind. This makes him question who he really is and how he fits into society. His experiences eventually lead him to a point where he can't stand the world anymore, but in a way that feels more personal and intense.

The show probably has multiple seasons, each building on the previous one's emotional depth. The ending might be somber or more tragic, emphasizing his struggle with reality versus illusion. I think it's set in the 1970s and 1980s, so there are some references to technology that he interacts with.

I'm trying to piece together all these elements without getting bogged down by too much detail. So, in summary, George has a mental illness causing him to reassemble parts of his past and experience intense emotional turmoil as he navigates reality versus illusion.
